# ARC-721: Is an Areon token standard that allows the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)


It’s an extension of Ethereum’s ERC-721, one of the most commonly used NFT standards and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each NFT is unique and is not interchanged with any other token.
ARC-721 tokens allow you to tokenize the ownership of data and attach to it a unique identifier. This aspect makes the token one of a kind and vastly different from ARC-20 tokens. With ARC-20, developers can create multiple identical tokens within one smart contract. However, with ARC-721, each token is assigned a different token ID.
Through these unique IDs, ARC-721 tokens can be used to represent collectible, non-fungible items. Users can trade and transfer these tokens based on their market value, which depends on the token’s rarity or utility.

Like other tokens on Areon, ARC-721 token transfers require AREA for gas fees.

## ARC-721 token functions
ARC-721 has a list of functions that govern how the token interacts with the BNB Smart Chain. Some of these are fairly standard and are also present in the ARC-20 standard:

* name: Defines the ARC-721 token’s name, which other contracts will identify it by

* Symbol: A shorter name for the token similar to a ticker symbol

* balanceOf: Shows the token balance of a specific address

* totalSupply: Defines the total number of the tokens created.

* tokenMetadata: This function allows for the inclusion of metadata into a token used to link to an artwork file or another collectible aspect of the NFT.
